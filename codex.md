# Codex Vitae
This Codex Vitae, or "book of life", is a collection of my beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.

## Instructions

**If you are Pavel Holyavkin:**

1. As often as you can: re-read your [Type 3 beliefs](#type-3-opinions) (opinions).
2. At the beginning of every month, read the whole thing and make any necessary edits.
3. At the beginning of every year archive the document.
4. Around your birthday every year, write a new yearly report.

**If you aren't Pavel Holyavkin:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than Pavel — the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the [Glossary](#glossary) for a general intro to my favorite ideas, starting with [What is this?](#what-is-this), then come back and read through the [Beliefs](#beliefs) that seem interesting to you. 
3. Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/spiritualcoach/Public/commits/master/codex.md) for updates since you last visited.
4. Consider creating your own Codex ([here's a template](https://www.penflip.com/terrie/codex-vitae-template))

## Beliefs

### 1. Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- Beliefs are words/rules/affirmations/story/brain-apps/lines-of-codes that runs our lives. #Note: From this point I will call belief as "words".
- By changing my "word set" I change my behaviour. Why? Beliefs -> Behaviour -> Habit -> Character -> Destiny

- This document's purpose is to capture my words about anything, analyze them and change to the most appropriate according to my final goal & choosen path.
- This document's benefits grow in a compound interest kind of way, over time, as words course correct over time, and build on one another.
- It's always incomplete and out of date.
- Words determine our behavior.
- Some of these words will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by getting new insights, evidence, persuasion, or chance.
- I believe words are best categorized into five types: words about beliefs (metabeliefs, i.e. this one), words about the world (how reality seems to be, the meaning of reality, opinions about how myself and others should approach life), words about others, words about myself, and words about the future (predictions about how things will be in the future).
- Making and maintaining this document is useful and fun. And increasingly rewarding over time.


#### Metaphysics:
- There is Ego and Now. When it's now there is no Ego.
- Life is a game. Enjoy it.
- Karma/luck/destiny/call/butterfly-effect exists/works: every event has cause and effect.
- You can only **feel** the True/source/God/soul/right/meaning/purpose/randomness, not **understand** it. My purpose is to be an awesome dad.
- Perception/sensation is the awareness of things changing. We can't perceive or sense things that aren't changing. Everything is changing, even permanent constants.
- Wisdom is a knowleadge applied to life.
- Evolution is the nature is learning by itself.
- If you want to understand recursion you need to understand recursion.
- Everything is going through cycle born and die.
- The Secret/transurfing works. Observe your thoughts. Think positive. Visualize your future.
- Placebo works better if you believe on it deeper with no doubt.
- Everything is the one/counsisncessness/the-matrix/AI, we are all connected.

#### 3. Perceptions.
Supersenses. My take on the spiritual and supernatural.

- Writing my mission/final_goal/destiny/call/way/path is like knowing the future: Bring awareness/counsisncessness to changes.
- My self-declared purpose is to enjoy quality time (with myself, my kids, my wife, my relatives, my friends, my partners) by discovering and removing obstacles that hinder quality time.
- Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life.
- Soul is a word describes the deepest meaning of person/animal/object.
— Spirit translated as a breath.
- Intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it, and makes us more likely to notice opportunities).
- Astrology/stars/sun/planets influent to us by gravitation.
- Science can't explain everything. Most in the "not yet" bucket, but some in the "never" bucket.
- Heaven/God/angels and hell/devil/demons starts from inside out.
— Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, Confucious were extraordinary human beings.

Explanatory. Science, politics, and the universe.

- We probably live in a simulation (the matrix) (see digital realism).
— We are biorobots (habits == apps), or phylosophical zombies (life addicted).
- Other dimensions and universes exist.
- Micro and macro evolution happens.
- Big Bang is like a reboot of the universe or a multiverse multiplication through the wormhole/black-hole.
- Nothing in our universe can travel faster than light.
- The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend our universe or multiverse.
- Non-carbon-based life forms exist.
- Aliens exist. Mostly our ancients/gods are aliens. We have aliens dna.
- Chakras exists.
- Aura is electro-magnetic field of the human body.
- Perception of time can be sped up or slowed down, but not reversed (forwards time travel is possible, backwards is not).
- Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics, energy, healthcare, travel, education).
- Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected.
- Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about ourselves, the world and are more connected with each other.
- For most questions answers might be found inside the self, Google & Wikipedia.
- Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely.
- Acupuncture works, somehow.
- Some vaccinations might be good, but better to improve immune system by cold shower, fasting & meditation.
- Editing DNA might be helpful.
- AI exists and getting more aware of itself.

### 6. Opinions
Words about how I interpret my perceptions and synthesize the meaning of reality. 6A is about what this means for my own approach to life, and 6B is about how I believe society should be structured.

#### 6A. Opinions: Shoulds
How I believe I should approach life. These are all opt-in and apply only to myself.
I should be proactive.
I should constantly grow.
I should be a good example for others.
I should live moral life.

#### 6B. Opinions: Society
How I believe society should be structured.

- Gay marriage should require a paper from a psychotherapist.
- Abortion should be illegal.
- Assisted suicide should be illegal.
- Communism + new technologies might bring a better world.
- Healthcare (physical & mental) should be available and affordable to everyone who needs it.
- The death penalty should be illegal.
- Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment.
- Marijuana is better medicine than alchohol and should be legal to grow, sell, buy, and carry.
– Any addictiviness (news/alcohol/marijuana/phone/sugar) should be explained in school.
- Owning a gun should illegal.
- It should be easier and more expedient to put neglectful and irresponsible public servants in prison than the average citizen, not slower and more difficult.
- Guaranteed basic income should be a thing available to everyone.
- Driver's license might be given person earlier if person will pass psychological test.
- There should be no boundaries between countries. Every one has a right to travel/live anywhere where he/she wants.
- Everyone should have health score: which might be calculated by several criterias.
- 

#### 6C. Opinions: Education
- Free college education should be available to everyone who wants it.
- There should be a religion science in the school which expains the differentiality and combination for every major religion.
- In schools children should pick up any science they want and finish the project (Montessori, Bill Gates school)

## Glossary
 
### What is this?
This document was started in [August of 2016](https://github.com/spiritualcoach/Public/commit/c99899e11d49a471ba31857320fd76245c2e39ab) as a result of an following VIP coaching on Coach.me.

### Codex vitae
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am. 

### Quality time
My own Codex Vitae's first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a life well lived. There are 3 kinds of quality time that I want to seek out. The first is quality time with myself. Find my favorite ideas, core interests, and people that I can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those favorite ideas and core interests, and the third is quality time with those people I can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other: I can't really connect deeply with others until I know myself sufficiently well; often times interests are strengthened by having people I can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with myself, my interests, and others and I won't regret anything on my death bed.
