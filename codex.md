# Codex Vitae
This Codex Vitae, or "book of life", is a collection of my beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.

## Instructions

**If you are Pavel Holyavkin:**

1. As often as you can: re-read your [Type 3 beliefs](#type-3-opinions) (opinions).
2. At the beginning of every month, read the whole thing and make any necessary edits.
3. At the beginning of every year archive the document.
4. Around your birthday every year, write a new yearly report.

**If you aren't Pavel Holyavkin:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than Pavel — the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the [Glossary](#glossary) for a general intro to my favorite ideas, starting with [What is this?](#what-is-this), then come back and read through the [Beliefs](#beliefs) that seem interesting to you. 
3. Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/spiritualcoach/Public/commits/master/codex.md) for updates since you last visited.
4. Consider creating your own Codex ([here's a template](https://www.penflip.com/terrie/codex-vitae-template))

## Beliefs

### 1. Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- Beliefs (brain apps) are a word set (lines of codes) I keep telling to itself every day.
- By changing this word set I change its destiny. Why? Words -> Beliefs -> Behaviour -> Habit -> Character -> Destiny.
- This document's purpose is to optimize capture the word set about anything, analyze them and change to the most appropriate according to my [ikigai](#9-ikigai)
- This document's benefits grow in a compound interest kind of way, over time, as words course correct over time, and build on one another.
- It's always incomplete and out of date.
- Some of believes will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by getting new insights, evidence, persuasion, or chance.
- I believe believes are best categorized into five types: believes about beliefs (metabeliefs, i.e. this one), believes about the world (how reality seems to be, the meaning of reality, opinions about how myself and others should approach life), believes about others, believes about myself, and believes about the future (predictions about how things will be in the future).
- Making and maintaining this document is useful and fun. And increasingly rewarding over time.

#### Metaphysics:
- Children are fruits of your heritage tree.
- Everything is connected into the spirit/one/counsisncessness/the-matrix - the internet of the universe.
- Body is a hardware. Mind/Ego (I) is a software (OS). Soul (i) is an operator (player).
- There is Ego and Now. When i am present (it's Now) there is no Ego.
- For i: life is a game. Enjoy it.
- For I: life is a pain. No pain - no gain. Learn the rules. Bend them. Win it.
To balance: think less, talk less, eat less, consume less, meditate more.
- Karma/luck/destiny/call/butterfly-effect exists/works: every event has cause and effect.
- Only i can **feel**, **know** the Truth/God/spirit/nature/source/meaning, but I can't **understand** it.
- Perception/sensation is the awareness of things changing. Everything is changing every moment, even permanent constants. Vibrations.
- Wisdom is a knowleadge applied to life.
- Evolution is the nature is learning by itself.
- If I want to understand recursion I need to understand recursion.
- Everything is going through cycle: born and die. I born and die every day (cells, neurons).
- Placebo works better if I believe with no doubt. But I am not 100% sure about this.

### 3. Perceptions.
**Supersenses. My take on the spiritual and supernatural.**

- Reviewing [my ikigai](#9-ikigai) reminds I why I am here.
- My self-declared purpose is to enjoy quality time (with myself, my kids, my wife, my family, my friends, my partners) by discovering and removing obstacles that hinder quality time.
- 💀 Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life.
- Soul is the deepest meaning of person/animal/object.
— Spirit translated as a breath.
- The Secret/transurfing/intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it, and makes us more likely to notice opportunities).
- 👨‍🚀 Astrology/stars/sun/planets influent to us by gravitation, the ultimate force. Maybe.
- ⚛️ Science can't explain everything. Most in the "not yet" bucket, but some in the "never" bucket.
- ☯️ Heaven/God/Creator/angels and hell/devil/demons starts from inside out.
— 🙃 Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, Confucious were extraordinary human beings.

**Explanatory. Science, politics, and the universe.**

- We probably live in a simulation (the matrix) (see digital realism).
— 🤖 We are biorobots (habits == brain apps), or phylosophical zombies (life addicted).
- Other dimensions and universes exist.
- ⏳ All possible variants of the future/past/present are exist in the same time.
- Micro and macro evolution happens.
- 💥 Big Bang is like a reboot of the universe or a multiverse multiplication through the wormhole/black-hole.
- ⚡️ Nothing in our universe can travel faster than light.
- 🧠 The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend our universe or multiverse.
- 🛸 Non-carbon-based life forms exist.
- 👽 Aliens exist. Mostly our ancients/gods are aliens. We have an aliens' DNA.
- 🌪 Chakras exists.
- Aura is electro-magnetic field of the human body. 
- 🚿 Detoxing cleans aura and increase frequency of thoughts.
- 👀 Perception of time can be sped up or slowed down, but not reversed (forwards time travel is possible, backwards is not).
- 🤖 Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics, energy, healthcare, travel, education).
- 🕵️‍ Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected.
- 😇 Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about ourselves, the world and are more connected with each other.
- ❓ For most questions answers might be found inside the self, search engine & Wikipedia.
- Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely.
- Acupuncture, reflexology, chiropractice works, somehow.
- 💉 Some vaccinations might be good, but better to improve immune system by cold, fasting, raw food diet & meditation.
- Editing DNA might be helpful.
- 🤖 AI exists and getting more aware of itself.

### 7. Predictions
How I think things will be in the future, based on the approximate year I think they’ll come true.

#### 7. Predictions: By 2025
- Global warming will severely impact the global economy in some way and threaten the livelihood of people in some parts of the world. Sea level will go upper. Some cities on the shores will go under water.
- The technology to program DNA (via CRISPR) will allow us to easily and cheaply edit, remove, and add DNA in embryos. We will start with obvious applications (like preventing Alzheimer's) but not stop there. This also will create mutations. It will take 10-20 years to master this technology.
- Self-driving vehicles will begin to replace truck & taxi drivers, impacting employment rates in the country. More programmers jobs will be on the market.

#### 7. Predictions: By 2030
- We'll have a president that admits to being atheist or agnostic.
- Genetically modified foods will become the norm. GMO food will cost even less than now comparing with Organic/non-GMO.
- The equivalent of a college education (both in breadth of knowledge and value to career) will be available to anyone with an internet connection.
- VR will recreate smell and taste feelings.

#### 7. Predictions: By 2050
- There would be more than half of Earth's population who stop eat animals.
- There would become a major phylosophy which will unite most people on the planet.

- Guaranteed basic income will be available in a majority of first world countries. Employment will be decoupled from having the means to live.
- People, organizations, and governments will exchange almost all privacy of personal data for interpersonal connection and technology personalization by machine learning services. It will be the norm.
- Solar will overcome gas and oil in usage.
- We will get first colony on Mars or under the water.

#### 7. Predictions: By 2100
- There will be 10 billion people on the planet at once.
- Physical travel will be almost unnecessary due to virtual reality technology.
- The number of living languages in the world will have dropped from about 7,000 in 2009 to under 100.

I am here to make the world the better place.
Be happy, healthy & wealthy. Live by family + dhamma + fruits.

## Glossary
 
### What is this?
This document was started in [August of 2016](https://github.com/spiritualcoach/Public/commit/c99899e11d49a471ba31857320fd76245c2e39ab) as a result of an following VIP coaching on Coach.me.

### Codex vitae
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am. Also it's a good message to my kids, so they can see the evolution of my vision. 

### Quality time
My own Codex Vitae's first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a life well lived. There are 3 kinds of quality time that I want to seek out. The first is quality time with myself. Find my favorite ideas, core interests, and people that I can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those favorite ideas and core interests, and the third is quality time with those people I can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other: I can't really connect deeply with others until I know myself sufficiently well; often times interests are strengthened by having people I can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with myself, my interests, and others and I won't regret anything on my death bed.
